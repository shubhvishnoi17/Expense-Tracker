# 💰 Expense Calculator App (Java Console Project)

This is a simple **Expense Calculator** built using **Java OOP concepts**. It allows users to add, view, and calculate total expenses through a console-based menu. The project demonstrates the use of **abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation**, and basic object-oriented programming techniques.

## 🧱 OOP Concepts Used
